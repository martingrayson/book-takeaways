# Culture Map

## Thinking

* There are two distinct styles of reasoning;
    * Principles-first reasoning (deductive reasoning) derives conclusions from facts or general principles. E.g. “All men are mortal” => “Justin Bieber is a man ergo he will eventually die”. 
    * Applications-first reasoning is when general conclusions are reached based on factual observations from the real world. Observations are extrapolated into broader conclusions.
* Most people are capable of both types of reasoning but your thinking is heavily influenced by your culture's thinking.
* How you explain a problem or a solution to a group of people will need tailoring to the group's cultural default. People from principles-first cultures want to understand the why behind a request. Applications-first learners want to focus on the how.

## Cross-cultural collaboration

* Cross-cultural collaboration can take more time than monocultural
* Cross-cultural collaboration can be sped up by having as few people in a group work across cultures as possible. The more experienced members of the team should be left to collaborate across cultures while the bulk of a team / those less experienced work in a way most natural to them
* Consider the larger objective before mixing cultures. Innovation and creativity requires mixing of cultures, speed and efficiency is better satisfied with monocultures

## Leading

* Egalitarian cultures are when the distance between a boss and a subordinate is low. The best boss is an equal. Structures are flat and you can skip levels to communicate.
* Hierarchical cultures have distinct differences between bosses and subordinates. The best bosses are strong directors who lead from the front. Status is important and communication should follow hierarchical lines.
* Defaulting to egalitarianism can have big problems in hierarchical cultures despite the UK perspective that being an equal is so ingrained into us.

## Decision making

* Within concental cultures, leaders have a responsibility to care for others and work towards their best interests. This leads to long decision making processes, but upon a decision action happens fast.
* Top-down cultures make decisions faster but are more open to change. Implementation can take longer because decisions change.
* To avoid culture clashes, in more consensual decision making teams;
    * Expect decision to take longer
    * Be patient and check-in with counterparts to show commitment
    * Cultivate relationships to help monitor where the group is in its process
    * Resist the urge to push for a quick decision.
* To avoid culture clashes, in more top-down decision making teams;
    * Expect decisions to be made by a boss with less discussion and less soliciting opinions.
    * Be ready to follow the decision even if your idea was overruled or your thoughts were not requested
    * When you are in charge, gather input but be ready to make quick decisions.
    * When a group is divided, take a vote and disagree and commit
    * Be flexible because decisions will change.

## Trust

* There are two types of trust, cognitive trust and affective trust
* Cognitive trust comes from a person's accomplishments, skills and reliability. It's built through business interactions.
* Affective trust is built through feelings of closeness and empathy. Friendship leads to affective trust.
* Different cultures will default to building trust within a scale of task-based trust and relationship-based trust.
* A friendly culture does not mean it’s a relationship-based/affective-trusting culture. The concept of a peach vs coconut.
